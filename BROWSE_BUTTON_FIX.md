# Browse Button Fix Documentation

## Problem Description

The Forever Yours Raw Compress application was experiencing UI freezing and crashes when users clicked the browse button. The primary issue occurred during folder scanning and file validation operations, which were being performed directly on the UI thread, causing it to become unresponsive (showing the "beach ball" cursor on macOS).

## Root Causes Identified

1. **UI Thread Blockage**: File scanning and validation operations were running on the main UI thread
2. **Recursive Directory Scans**: Deep recursive scanning was unnecessary given the known folder structure
3. **FFmpeg Process Hanging**: No timeout handling for FFmpeg subprocess calls
4. **Limited Error Handling**: Exception propagation between components was insufficient
5. **No Progress Feedback**: Users had no visibility into long-running operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Moving File Operations to Background Thread

We implemented a worker class (`ScanWorker`) that runs in a background thread using PyQt's `QThread`:

```python
class ScanWorker(QObject):
    # Signals for communication with the UI thread
    cam_folders_found = pyqtSignal(list)
    files_found = pyqtSignal(list)
    status_update = pyqtSignal(str, str)
    progress_update = pyqtSignal(int, int)
    task_completed = pyqtSignal()
    error_occurred = pyqtSignal(str)
    
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.folder_path = ""
        self.cancel_requested = False
    
    @pyqtSlot()
    def scan_folder(self):
        # All file scanning operations moved here
        # Results communicated back to UI using signals
```

The worker thread is properly initialized and connected to the UI:

```python
# In ImportPanel.__init__
self.worker_thread = QThread()
self.worker = ScanWorker()
self.worker.moveToThread(self.worker_thread)

# Connect signals
self.worker.cam_folders_found.connect(self.on_cam_folders_found)
self.worker.files_found.connect(self.on_files_found)
self.worker.status_update.connect(self.on_status_update)
self.worker.error_occurred.connect(self.on_error)
self.worker.task_completed.connect(self.on_task_completed)

# Connect thread start to worker processing slot
self.worker_thread.started.connect(self.worker.scan_folder)
```

### 2. Optimized Folder Scanning

We optimized the file scanning process to use the known folder structure instead of deep recursion:

```python
# Direct path to the expected video location
media_path = os.path.join(self.folder_path, "03 MEDIA")
video_path = os.path.join(media_path, "01 VIDEO")

# Get CAM folders without walking the entire directory tree
potential_cam_folders = []
for item in os.listdir(video_path):
    item_path = os.path.join(video_path, item)
    if os.path.isdir(item_path) and "CAM" in item.upper():
        potential_cam_folders.append(item_path)
```

### 3. Added Progress Indicators

Progress dialog shows users what's happening and allows them to cancel long operations:

```python
# Create progress dialog
self.progress_dialog = QProgressDialog("Scanning for video files...", "Cancel", 0, 100, self)
self.progress_dialog.setWindowTitle("Scanning")
self.progress_dialog.setWindowModality(Qt.WindowModality.WindowModal)
self.progress_dialog.setMinimumDuration(500)  # Only show for operations > 500ms
self.progress_dialog.canceled.connect(self.worker.cancel)
```

### 4. Implemented FFmpeg Process Timeouts

Added timeout handling for FFmpeg processes to prevent hanging:

```python
try:
    result = subprocess.run(cmd, capture_output=True, text=True, timeout=30)
    
    # Process result...
except subprocess.TimeoutExpired:
    logger.warning(f"FFmpeg validation timed out for file: {file_path}")
    # Return True to allow the file to be added to the queue even when timeout occurs
    return True
```

### 5. Improved Error Handling

Enhanced exception handling and error propagation throughout the application:

```python
try:
    # Operation that might fail
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"Error message: {str(e)}", exc_info=True)
    self.error_occurred.emit(f"Error: {str(e)}")
```

## How to Apply These Fixes to the Main Application

The fixes have already been implemented in `gui/step1_import.py` and `core/file_preparation.py`. Here's how to integrate them into the main application:

1. **Ensure Proper QThread Management**:
   - Never start threads in constructor methods
   - Always clean up threads in the `closeEvent` method
   - Use signals for cross-thread communication, never direct method calls

2. **Check for Other UI Blocking Operations**:
   - Review all code that interacts with the file system or runs external processes
   - Move these operations to background threads using a similar pattern
   - Pay special attention to `gui/step2_convert.py` and `gui/step3_results.py`

3. **Add Timeouts to All Subprocess Calls**:
   - Review all uses of `subprocess.run()` in the codebase
   - Add appropriate timeout parameters (typically 30 seconds for validation, longer for actual conversions)
   - Handle timeout exceptions gracefully

4. **Improve Progress Reporting**:
   - Add progress indicators for all long-running operations
   - Ensure all operations provide feedback to users
   - Make all operations cancellable when possible

5. **Test Thoroughly**:
   - Test with large folders containing many video files
   - Verify that the UI remains responsive during all operations
   - Test cancel functionality and error handling scenarios

## Conclusion

These changes address the core issues causing the browse button crash. The application is now more responsive, provides better feedback to users, and handles errors more gracefully. These patterns should be applied throughout the codebase to ensure consistent behavior and prevent similar issues in other parts of the application.
